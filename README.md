## About

I simulated a decentralized block chain using node.js and simple javascript. Currently this uses the sha256 hashing method, validation using proofOfWork that validates the blockchain, a consensus algorithm using the longest chain method. You can use this to understand the many uses blockchain and why it is so secure.

## To use

npm install // to install the dependencies

I will make a online web visual web interface later in the future.

npm run node_1 // to set up the different nodes
npm run node_2
npm run node_3
npm run node_4
npm run node_5

refer to networkNode.js for the items to push to different routes using Postman

the isValid method validates an entire blockchain for validity
